Below is a preview of some my personal projects I have done to better my developer skills.

## Graphing Work Performance
A retail company that fulfills ecommerce orders, tracks work performance by measuring certain metrics e.g. how many units are scanned in per hour or UPH. The current method is time consuming, by printing out said metrics and calculating the difference compared to last weeks by hand. I created a program that takes a CSV file and plots it using Python and Pyplot.
##### CSV file sample
![eStore Partner Metrics](https://github.com/j-leeroy/UPH_Data/blob/master/tabula-09-17_09-24.csv)

My program scans this file and several others to graph UPH against a particular User over a 4 week period.

Now instead of calculating the metrics by hand you have a nice visual represenation of changes in productivity. 

## Scraping Social Media Reddit
Was curious to see what users on Reddit are saying an online grocercy store.This is my first attempt at scraping for data on the web using PRAW api. The program searches the subreddit /Texas for mentions an online grocery store and returns a CSV file with Title, Author, URL link, and time stamp of top 100 post. The program also stores the information in a Dataframe that can manipulate the metrics however needed.
As of 2-27-19 here are the top 100 post on subreddit /Texas of a grocery store.
