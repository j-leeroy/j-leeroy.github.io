Below is a preview of some my personal projects I have done to better my developer skills.

## Graphing Work Performance
At my current company, H-E-B, my manager keeps tabs on our performance by tracking certain metrics. The current method is time consuming, by printing out said metrics and calculating the difference compared to last weeks. I created a program that takes a CSV file and plots it using Python and Pyplot.
##### CSV file sample

      )

My program scans this file and several others to graph UPH against a particular User over a 4 week period.

Now instead of calculating the metrics by hand you have a nice visual represenation of changes in productivity. 

## Scraping Social Media Reddit
Was curious to see what users on Reddit are saying about my current company H-E-B.This is my first attempt at scraping for data on the web using PRAW api. The program searches the subreddit /Texas for mentions of H-E-B and returns a CSV file with Title, Author, URL link, and time stamp of top 100 post. The program also stores the information in a Dataframe that can manipulate the metrics however needed.
As of 2-27-19 here are the top 100 post on subreddit /Texas mentioning H-E-B.
